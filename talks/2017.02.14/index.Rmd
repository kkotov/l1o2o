## Status

In preparation for 2017 data following PRs were made:

* [17059](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/17059) - some redesigning of the XML parsing to speed it up
* [17295](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/17295) - integrating the CaloParams prototype DB payload
* [17461](https://github.com/cms-sw/cmssw/pull/17461) - new online DB schema (yet to be merged)

Positive experience from MWGR I:
* The new online DB schema didn't change for L1 Menu -> old L1T O2O was stripped to work with the menu only and did the job

Once fresh CMSSW with all the above PRs is available the full blown L1T O2O should be ready for the new data
