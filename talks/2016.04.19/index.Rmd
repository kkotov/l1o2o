## New online DB schema (top level)

The very top level of the `CMS_TRG_L1_CONG` schema includes all L1T systems (almost) uniformly:

<img class=center src=schema.svg height=220>

It is integrated in swatch and editable with the old L1 Configuration Editor

Several XMLs per key:

## L1T O2O workflow

Bookkeeping relies on [L1TriggerKeyList](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondFormats/L1TObjects/interface/L1TriggerKeyListExt.h)
(`keyList`) listing all payloads ever written to CondDB

L1T O2O gets evoked by the Function Manager and performs two steps:

1) Write payloads [step](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/scripts/runL1-O2O-iov.sh#L49):

* do nothing [if](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/scripts/runL1-O2O-iov.sh#L46) the current `TSC` key is already in the `keyList`, [else](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt.cc#L67):
  * [loop](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt.cc#L112) over all records in `TSC` key
and [check](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt.cc#L124) if 
(`record`,`key`) pair is already in `keyList`
  * if not, [write](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt.cc#L143) payload to
    DB, and [extend](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBPayloadWriterExt.cc#L164) `keyList` with the new (`record`,`key`,`db_token`)

2) Write IOVs [step](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/scripts/runL1-O2O-iov.sh#L59) (i.e. write to the `IOV` table of CondDB (`db_token`,`first_run_valid`) pairs):

* [update](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBIOVWriterExt.cc#L81) payload's IOV for the `TSC` key by its `db_token`
* [loop](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBIOVWriterExt.cc#L134) over all (`record`,`key`) pairs in the `TSC` key
  * [extract](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBIOVWriterExt.cc#L165) `db_token` from the `keyList`
  * [update](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/blob/master/CondTools/L1TriggerExt/plugins/L1CondDBIOVWriterExt.cc#L177) `IOVs` for the `db_token`

## Subsystem modules for the L1T O2O framework

Each L1T subsystem instantiates two ESProducers (see examples in [L1TriggerConfig](https://github.com/kkotov/l1o2o/tree/master/L1TriggerConfig)): 

1) `*ObjectKeysOnlineProd*` exploring tables in [slide #3](index.html#3) and relating `record` to `key`

2) `*OnlineProd*` pulling actual online DB configuration and constructing the payload:
  * using the key from previous step fetch all the relevant XML strings
  * build an associated array `subkey` -> XML string
  * pass it over to the [trigSystem](https://github.com/cms-l1t-offline/cmssw/blob/cms_o2o_devel-CMSSW_8_0_2/L1Trigger/L1TCommon/src/trigSystem.cpp) that
'll parse the XMLs and merge contexts
  * feed the results to the relevant CondFormats helper classes to construct the payload

The last couple of bullets are currently being developed with help from Vangelis and Thomas

The XML parser/merger code is (almost) ready and should be recycled in swatch

Once above is done, the producers above become trivial and I'll be to happy implement them

## Summary

<br>

* Converging rapidly to having the complete L1T O2O ready

* Need last push to get all CondFormats helper classes running off the `trigSystem` results

* The `ALGO`/`RS` tables for the subsystems of course have to be populated

* May still need just a bit of work on the swatch cells for systems
